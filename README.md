## iOS Bootcamp Challenge

You must solve this challenge in order to be an attendee in the Wizeline
Academy's iOS Bootcamp! But don't worry, you won't face any complex algorithms nor tricky questions about complexity. :) 
Instead, you'll have to solve a series of tasks regarding the basic principles of iOS Development.

What we have here is a little Pokedex app (which uses the famous [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)).

The topics covered by the challenge are:

### Networking & Data
 
The ListViewController contains a collection of PokeCells which display a list of Pokemons to the user.
You need to handle the PokeApi to retrieve each Pokemon detail.

### Concurrency
Requests in the project take different times to return data!
Make sure you are finished downloading all pokemons before updating the CollectionView


### Patterns and Architecture

To display more info about a Pokemon we provided a SearchBar and DetailViewController objects, 
however, they are not in use yet! You need to implement them and handle the navigation 
to allow the user to search and select a Pokemon from the ListViewController to display it in detail.

You can encapsulate your components in the same file or create more files in the project.

### Views & Layouts
Let's display the Pokemons details like the image, type, and attacks. Whatever you wanna display.
We provided a start UI using Layout Constraints in the code, but feel free to use Frames or the Storyboard!

#### Extras
If you have time left address the extra TODO's inside the project to show off your skills!

## Code Review Process

You'll receive this challenge as a zip file, with no git repo available. After you receive it, take the following steps to resolve it:

1. Create a git repo to track your solutions (use the command `$ git init`).
2. Solve the challenges, creating a commit for every exercise.
3. After you complete the challenges, create a private repo on Github and push your code.
4. Add your mentor as a contributor, so they can check your code.
